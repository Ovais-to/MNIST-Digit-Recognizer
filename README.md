# **MNIST Digit Recognizer**

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Utilizing Logistic Regression, this project demonstrates the basic principles of image classification, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

**Features:**

1. Data preprocessing and visualization
2. Application of Logistic Regression for binary classification
3. Model performance evaluation using cross-validation
4. Predictions on individual digit examples

**Installation:**
To set up the project environment, run the following command to install the required packages:

**pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib**

**Usage:**
The code is designed to be executed sequentially. It begins with loading the MNIST dataset, followed by data preprocessing, training the Logistic Regression model, and finally, evaluating the model's performance.

**Visualization:**
Here's a snapshot of the code and the visualization of a digit from the MNIST dataset:

**Model Performance:**
The Logistic Regression model is evaluated using cross-validation to ensure its effectiveness. The scores are printed out to provide insight into the accuracy of the model across different subsets of the data.
